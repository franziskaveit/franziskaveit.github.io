			<p>Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at DYNAMICS and Humboldt University of Berlin <a href="https://link/"
					target="_blank">University</a>. My research lies at the intersection of political economy and political sociology.
				Specifically, I study how formative economic experiences shape political attitudes throughout the life course. </p>

					<b><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/876dr" target="_blank">The Green Transition and Political
							Polarization
							Along Occupational Lines</a></b>
					(with Hanno Hilbig and Erik Voeten). R&R, <i><b>American Political Science Review</b></i>.

					<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('energytransition');">[Abstract]</a></i>
					<div id="energytransition" style="display:none;"><br> Green transition policies set long-term
						targets to reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants, posing a threat to workers in polluting
						occupations and communities reliant on these occupations. Can far right parties attract voters
						who anticipate losing from the green transition? We explore this in Germany, which has ambitious
						green policies and a large workforce in polluting occupations. The far right AfD started
						campaigning as the only party opposing green transition policies in 2016. Using a
						difference-in-differences design, we show AfD support increased in counties with more polluting
						jobs after this platform change. A panel survey further demonstrates that individuals in these
						occupations also shifted towards the AfD. Probing mechanisms, we find suggestive evidence that
						growing far right support is due to changing perceptions of social stigma and lower status. Our
						results highlight the need for a new research agenda on a backlash against the normative
						dimension of the green transition. </div>

					<b><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6h8cq" target="_blank">Place-Based Policies, Local
							Responses, and
							Electoral Behavior</a></b>
					(with Hanno Hilbig and Andreas Wiedemann).

					<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('grw');">[Abstract]</a></i>
					<div id="grw" style="display:none;"><br> Place-based economic policies are increasingly seen as
						instruments to counter political discontent in economically-depressed regions. Do regional
						investment subsidies affect electoral behavior? We evaluate this question in the context of
						Germany's largest regional investment program. Our identification strategy leverages a 2014
						subsidy rate cut for manufacturing firms that - due to EU rules - was exogenous to local
						economic trends. The subsidy cut reduced voting for the far-right AfD and increased support for
						the incumbent Christian Democrats. We then demonstrate that subsidy cuts trigger two
						counterreactions: local firms invest more in human capital and local governments invest more in
						infrastructure and public goods. We argue that these dynamics signal to voters that local
						governments are responsive and care about their constituents, undermining populist appeals. Our
						findings suggest that political consequences of place-based policies - and austerity more
						broadly - cannot be understood without considering counteractions by local firms and
						governments.</div>

					<b>Long-run Political Change after the Great Recession</b>
					(with Hanno Hilbig). (draft available upon request)

					<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('recession');">[Abstract]</a></i>
					<div id="recession" style="display:none;"><br> What are the long-term political consequences of
						economic crises? We assess the enduring impact of the Great Recession on U.S. political
						outcomes. We employ a difference-in-differences approach, leveraging geographic variation in
						unemployment shocks. Contrary to claims that major recessions primarily boost anti-incumbent,
						far-right candidates, we find that counties more severely affected by the recession experienced
						a sustained increase in Democratic vote shares, particularly in Congressional elections. These
						effects persisted for at least 10 years. We demonstrate that these results are unlikely to be
						due to persistent economic decline, demographic changes, shifts in candidate ideology, or fiscal
						compensation spending. Instead, survey evidence suggests that the recession lowered expectations
						for upward mobility, likely increasing support for redistribution and thereby benefiting
						Democratic candidates. Our findings expand the literature by showing that (i) severe economic
						shocks do not necessarily favor right-wing populists, and (ii) major downturns can continue to
						influence electoral outcomes long after direct economic consequences have subsided.

					<b><a href="https://osf.io/x23bj_v2" target="_blank">Economic Insecurity Increases
							Affective
							Polarization and Outgroup-Aversion </a></b>
					(with Joanna Bryson).

					<i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('polarization');">[Abstract]</a></i>
					<div id="polarization" style="display:none;"><br> Affective polarization - a deep emotional divide
						between opposing social and political groups - has become a pressing global governance
						challenge, disrupting both democratic processes and policy uptake. While some degree of position
						polarization should be expected in a healthy, multi-party political system, the factors driving
						recent extremes in divisions remain unclear. One candidate factor, economic instability, has
						been frequently linked to rising polarization, but causal evidence to date has been limited.
						Using panel survey data from the Netherlands and a difference-in-differences design, we show
						that economic insecurity significantly increases affective polarization. The effect persists for
						years, with a longer (though slower) expression among men. It is also accompanied by increased
						distrust and social group clustering. Our findings suggest that economic insecurity is a key
						driver of polarization, highlighting the role of labor market stability in shaping political and
						social cohesion.
