  <b>Inheriting Uncertainty? Intergenerational Perspectives on Economic Risk and Political Attitudes</b>
  <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('housing');">[Description]</a></i>
  <div id="housing" style="display:none;"><br>
    My dissertation investigates how early-life exposure to economic risk shapes long-term political attitudes, particularly far-right support and anti-immigration attitudes. Existing research often explains political behavior through current economic conditions or attitudinal correlates, overlooking how persistent predispositions may be rooted in earlier experiences and longer-term socialization. Drawing on theories of political socialization and shifting attention from immediate material circumstances to formative economic experiences, my dissertation adopts a life-course perspective on political attitude formation. I argue that exposure to economic insecurity during adolescence and young adulthood – such as parental job loss or growing up in high-unemployment regions – can foster lasting sensitivities to economic risk and perceptions of status threat. These, in turn, may increase receptiveness to political actors who mobilize around economic anxiety. Using national panel data, labor market statistics, and European cross-sectional survey data, the three projects assess: (1) the impact of parental unemployment on party support, (2) whether growing up in high-unemployment regions influences anti-immigration attitudes in adulthood, and (3) whether cohabitation with parents in adulthood for economic reasons relates to far-right support. By bridging political sociology and political economy, my dissertation contributes to understanding how long-run material experiences shape political attitudes – especially in ways that transcend current material conditions and helps explain why short-term economic changes only have a transient effect on attitudes, or why individuals often hold preferences that appear misaligned with their self-interest.

        Does early-life exposure to economic uncertainty fuel a persistent fear of economic decline, increasing anti-immigration attitudes in adulthood? While economic hardship is often assumed to drive opposition to immigration, empirical studies have found only modest and inconsistent effects of both recessions and individual economic conditions on anti-immigration attitudes. I test one possible explanation for this puzzle: that exposure to labor market risk during adolescence fosters a persistent sensitivity to economic risk, heightening susceptibility to anti-immigration narratives in adulthood. I build on political socialization research, which highlights formative years as a critical period for the formation of stable, long-term political attitudes. Leveraging data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP, 1993–2023) linked to district-level historical employment data, I show that growing up in districts with higher unemployment rates between ages 14 and 18 is associated with higher levels of concern about immigration later in life. This relationship holds across model specifications and persists in a two-step fixed effects estimation that isolates stable individual predispositions. By linking formative economic experiences with adult political outcomes, this study moves beyond individual current economic conditions to explain anti-immigration attitudes. As such, it has implications for research on political behavior and the long-term political impact of economic crises.
