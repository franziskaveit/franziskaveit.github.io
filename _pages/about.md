I am currently working as a research fellow at Prof. Dr. [Heike Kluever](https://www.heike-kluever.com/)’s [Chair of Comparative Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/de/lehrbereiche/politischesverhalten/team/frederik-thieme) at Humboldt University Berlin, while pursuing my PhD. 

My main methodological interests are quantitative research 📊, causal inference and experimental methods 🔀. In terms of content, I am interested in economic inequality 💸, its causes and consequences, particularly in connection to climate politics 🌍 and people's green attitudes ♻️.

If you want to talk about my research, hit me up anytime via [✉️ Mail](mailto:frederik.thieme@hu-berlin.de) or find me on [🟦 BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/frederikthieme.bsky.social).
